# Portfolio page, blog, and home to random tech I feel like building? Stay tuned

## Questions & Tasks:

- how much faster is intra network communication on a docker-compose network?
- how to undertake load balancing for requests from frontend client using NGINX etc?
- CI/CD for deployment
- Testing/Staging environments
- figma wireframes 
- add server flow diagrams, tech specs and elastic registry for blog aspect
- add redis cache for session info storage
